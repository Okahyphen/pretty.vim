This is a very simple syntax highlight making use of only five main colours, whose goal is to be lightweight, easy on the eyes, and uncluttered.

It has a particular focus on Lua and C, but has sensible enough defaults for most languages. However, YMMV.

It targets GUI versions of (neo)Vim, or terminal emulators that support true colour. It does not support ANSI or 256 sets.

It sets background as dark, and pairs well with a dark terminal.
